In the following sections you will find instructions to run the algorithms in the papers. The name of the jar file generated by this commit is EfficientHillClimbers-0.7-GECCO2018.jar

# Enhancing Partition Crossover with Articulation Points Analysis (GECCO 2018)

In order to run the algorithms you need first to compile and package them into a JAR file (see instructions at the bottom of the page). Then, you can run them with the following commands:

* For DRILS+APX solving NKQ Landscapes

java -jar <jarfile name> drils+apx-nk  <options omitted>

* For DRILS+APX solving MAX-SAT

java -jar <jarfile name> drils+apx-maxsat  <options omitted>

* For DRILS (using PX) solving NKQ Landscapes

java -jar <jarfile name> drils-nk  <options omitted>

* For DRILS (using PX) solving MAX-SAT

java -jar <jarfile name> drils-maxsat <options omitted>


To see the options, just run the algorithms without options. 


# Optimizing One Million Variable NK Landscapes by Hybridizing Deterministic Recombination and Local Search (GECCO 2017)

In order to run the algorithms you need first to compile and package them into a JAR file (see instructions at the bottom of the page). Then, you can run them with the following commands:

* For HiReLS

java -jar <jarfile name> px  <options omitted>

* For DRILS

java -jar <jarfile name> rball+ils+px  <options omitted>

To see the options, just run the algorithms without options. 

# Multi-objective Hamming Ball Hill Climber (GECCO 2016 and EvoCOP 2016)


In order to run the Multi-Objective Hamming Ball Hill Climber of EvoCOP 2016 select the "mo-hbhc" experiment using this string as the first argument after the JAR file name:

java -jar <jarfile name> mo-hbhc

In order to run the Hill Climber for Constrained Problems (explained in the GECCO 2016 paper), you should select the "moc-hbhc" experiment:

java -jar <jarfile name> moc-hbhc

If you run without any other argument, a list of all the options will appear with an explanation of their meaning.


**Note**: After submitting the camera-ready of the EvoCOP 2016 paper, a bug was found that could affect the results. In this branch the bug is fixed. The exact version used for the experiments in the EvoCOP 2016 paper is commit: https://github.com/jfrchicanog/EfficientHillClimbers/commit/213036ef593bb25617b48dcb58e81097a3437d71 .


# Instructions to build the software

The repository contains Java code shipped as a maven project. Maven 3 is needed as prerequisite. In order to build the executable JAR file open the command line and write:

mvn package

This will generate a JAR file in the target directory with all the dependencies included. To run the JAR file write:

java -jar <jarfile name>

The list of options are the different experiments available.
